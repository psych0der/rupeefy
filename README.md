=======

chrome extension for converting dollar rated to rupee based on current rates.

~~~~~

Rupeefy uses google finance calculator to fetch latest dollar to rupee conversion rate, this eleminates need to susbcribe to expensive apis.

Crux of this extensions lies in grabbing dollar amount strings from different websites , because there is no fixed scheme of displaying dollar rate.Hence effort has been made to deploy robust regex to match maximum websites and provide the desired output.

Can be extended to provide outputs for different currencies.Patches welcome
